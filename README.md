## Frontend Technical Test - Junior


### Task Instructions

During your technical test interview we require you to implement a basic site using the provided desktop, tablet and mobile designs and associated images. The first part of the task requires you to build a responsive layout using a combination of HTML and CSS that displays correctly for the relevant device types. For this part of the test it is expected that the images and data displayed under or next to each image are hard coded. The second part of the interview is to use your JavaScript skills to dynamically populate and display the data in the white section below or alongside each image. The white section should be adapted to be initially hidden and should expand, with data populated ideally using some kind of animation as each image is clicked. 

Please use your choice of IDE and development tools and feel free to use your usual online sources by way of reference e.g. to check syntax. If you do not complete the test then do not panic. The aim of this interview is to assess your competency level.

Before your interview feel free to create your basic application structure and bring in the images/assets that we have provided so that you have a basic shell of an application to start the exercise from. Other than that, please do not complete the exercise in advance. The test is to watch how you work and approach the task.

The data for each vehicle can be found in the vechicle.json file in the /data folder. Designs in the /design folder and images in the /images folder.


#### Acceptance Criteria
We have a high focus on attention to details in code

* We expect the JavaScript codebase to be written using ES6+ and libraries kept to a minimum
* Mobile-first development approach using min-width media queries
* Solution should be accessible and meet WCAG 2.1
* No CSS framework allowed
* Internally, we use BEM - but we are open to other CSS naming conventions as long as it's built with scale and maintenance in mind

We have a high focus on attention to details in design

* We expect the designs to match as closely as possible, ready for a designer to review
* Correct semantic HTML mark-up and/or CSS should be used to achieve the size and aspect ratio of the images in the design
* Interactions and animations to be considered but not distracting users away from the experience
* Minimal visual bugs when going resizing to mobile and large screen sizes

#### Nice to have
If you have achieved primary tasks and would like to showcase your skills by implementing additional feature(s) then you can consider the following:

* An accessible modal implementation which displays the additional vehicle information e.g. emission, bodystyle
* A staggered fade in vehicle cards on load
* Anything else which we cannot think of!
